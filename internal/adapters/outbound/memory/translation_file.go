// a business fact somebody must own, and pretending it can be DERIVED —
// by string convention, or by asking a catalogue that has never heard of
// the network's identifiers — is how an ACL quietly stops being one.

// Without this, the dictionary is empty in every deployment and EVERY
// order rejects as untranslatable: the inbound leg looks alive, answers
// the network in the negative every time, and the cause is invisible
// because refusing unknown products is also correct behaviour.

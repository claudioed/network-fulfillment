// networkOrderResponse is a NetworkOrder as this context's REST surface
// exposes it.

// WHAT IS ABSENT IS THE POINT. This context holds the network's
// ship-to name, address and phone (ADR 0001 hard rule 2: customer PII
// stops here), and no field of this struct can carry any of it. The
// aggregate does not model PII today, so this DTO is not yet removing
// anything — it is the place that must keep refusing to add it when the
// ship-to detail the outbound legs need does arrive.
//
// The network's own identifiers ARE exposed: a reader of this surface is
// an operator asking "what did we tell the network about purchase order
// X", and that question is unanswerable without them. They are the
// network's references, not its customer's identity.

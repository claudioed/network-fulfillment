// SweepAcknowledgementDeadlines finds orders whose 24h acknowledgement
// window has closed with no answer (ADR 0001 §6).
//
// A miss is a REPORTED FACT, not an error: the window has already
// closed, so there is nothing left to prevent and nothing to retry. The
// only useful acts are to record it and to stop holding inventory for
// demand we never answered — which is the orphaned-hold gap both ADRs
// named as their honest open consequence, closed here.
//
// It deliberately does NOT acknowledge late. An acknowledgement after
// the SLA instant is worse than none: the network has already re-sourced
// the order, and confirming it would commit us to a shipment nobody is
// expecting.
//
// Modelled on fulfillment-execution's SweepCPTMisses, which solves the
// structurally identical problem for internal cutoffs.

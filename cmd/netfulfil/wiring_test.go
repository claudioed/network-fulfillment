// caught the defect this file's retry exists to fix.
//
// retry_test.go proves the retry HELPER works. That is not the same claim
// as "wireOrders uses it": the shipped version called RunMigrations
// directly, so a single Istio first-dial reset — a known, transient
// condition in this cluster — became CrashLoopBackOff, and every helper
// test still passed. Verified by reverting wireOrders to the direct call;
// this test fails, the helper's own tests do not.
//
// It drives wireOrders against an unreachable address and asserts on the
// ELAPSED time: a single attempt returns fast, whereas the retry budget
// cannot be paid in less than the sum of its backoffs.
